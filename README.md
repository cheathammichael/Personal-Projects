# Personal-Projects

These are personal projects of mine with varying functionality, though my preference is usually creating solo addons for existing products. 

Realm of the Dice Gods - Also available on the Google Play Store, this is my first mobile app. It is a simple room generator for D&D.
To use it you will need the core books and materials, as it does not include a die roller or any monster stats. I'm pretty proud of it though.

The second project here is The Changeling, which is a program I wrote in C# using Visual Studio. It simulates an opponent Magic: the Gathering player
using die rolls and charts. It needs some cleaning up, but this is the Alpha 0.9 build.
